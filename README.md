# IP Update

<p>IP Update will get your external IP address and place it in a file of your choice.</p>
<p>Personally, I'd choose a file in your Dropbox or Google Drive folder so that you'll always have access to the IP.</p>
<p>It was created so that I could have access to my home network while away and without too much hassle.</p>
